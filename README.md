This is a little java program I wrote for myself several months ago. It runs a timer to keep track of time and stores the
sessions in a SQLite database. It supports multiple databases and it can export a range of sessions into a text file.
Unfortunately there isn't any documentation because I was working quickly (I think I wrote all the code in a single day),
but maybe I will return to it some day to make it more presentable.
